# 3D-Printer-Tracker
3D Printer Tracking Android App

This is an Android App I created to track 3D printers in a large 3D printing facility. You can add a printer, track when it was bought, track how much it has been used, etc. etc. This project has fallen off my priority list as I've gotten busy with school and solar car, but I plan to come back to it later.
